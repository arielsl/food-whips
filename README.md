## Idea
Often times, we as students (and others too!) don't know what to eat or cook at home. We are tired of the same old food and want to try something a little bit different. One way was to make use of the ingredients lying around the house, but we don't know exactly what to do or make with them. Thus, the idea of Food Whips was born.

## Basis
The purpose of the android application is to provide the user easy access to a variety of recipes based on their own criteria. This includes features such as searching for recipes base by ingredients (inclusion and exclusion), holidays, diets, and more.


## Features
- Base navigation drawer for easy traversing to multiple parts of the application
- Store recipes into a local database to save them for future purposes
- Camera and Photo feature to allow the user to attach a photo of their version of the recipe
- Various filter options (Search by Name, Search by Ingredients, Search by Cuisine)
- Random recipe option for the indecisive


## Functions
### For Navigation Drawer

#### Favorites Activity:
- Gives a list of all recipes the user has favorited
- If the user updates (i.e. tapping and un-favoriting a recipe), this list reflects the changes accordingly

#### Search by Name Activity:
- Narrows down results of recipes based on max time, diet, holidays, and cuisine
- Time is required but all other options are optional

#### Search by Ingredients Activity:

- User can tap on 'Add' button to dynamically create extra text fields
- If user wants to include an ingredient, select the radio button for 'Include', otherwise select 'Exclude'

#### Search by Cuisine Activity

### For Recipe Details
- Displays general information given about the recipe in the General tab and ingredients needed in the Ingredients tab

##### Clipboard/Instructions icon

##### Heart/Favorites icon
- Changes depending if the recipe is marked as a favorite or not
- Heart will be filled if marked as a favorite, otherwise, it will be a heart outline
